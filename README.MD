# Sales Price Prediction 

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a sales price prediction model that predicts the sale of a product based on various input features, such as item price, weight, outlet type, and outlet size. The prediction model can be useful for businesses and retailers to estimate the potential sales of a product before making strategic decisions, such as pricing, inventory management, and marketing strategies.

## Project Structure

The project's directory structure is organized as follows:

```
- data/              # Contains the dataset files (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling
- models/            # Saved trained models
- setup.py           # Setup script for installing the package
- requirements.txt   # List of required Python libraries and versions
- README.md          # Project Readme file (you are currently reading it)
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project should be placed in the `data/` directory. It should be a structured dataset with the following columns:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for the item
Item_Weight: The weight of the product (numerical feature)
Item_Fat_Content: The fat content of the item (categorical feature)
Item_Visibility: The visibility of the item in the outlet (numerical feature)
Item_Type: The type/category of the item (categorical feature)
Item_MRP: The Maximum Retail Price of the item (numerical feature)
Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for the outlet
Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year the outlet was established (numerical feature)
Outlet_Size: The size of the outlet (categorical feature)
Outlet_Location_Type: The type of location where the outlet is situated (categorical feature)
Outlet_Type: The type of outlet (categorical feature)
Item_Outlet_Sales: The target variable representing the sales of the product (numerical

Ensure that the dataset is clean and doesn't contain missing or erroneous values.

## Setup and Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaneesh-Pathak/Sales-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

```bash
cd sales-price-prediction
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Place the dataset file (e.g., `sales_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

6. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the model.

## Model Training

The model training process can be found in the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset and inspect its structure and statistics.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding), and perform any necessary feature scaling.
3. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the regression task (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.).

## Prediction

Once the model is trained and saved in the `models/` directory, you can use it to make predictions on new data or unseen samples. To make predictions, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model from the `models/` directory.
2. Preprocess the input data (e.g., ensure it has the same format as the training data, handle missing values, perform feature scaling, etc.).
3. Use the loaded model to predict sales for the given input data.

## Conclusion

This Sales Price Prediction project aims to help businesses estimate the potential sales of a product based on input features like item price, weight, outlet type, and outlet size. By following the steps outlined in this Readme file, you should be able to run the project, train the prediction model, and make sales predictions for new data.

Feel free to modify or extend the project to suit your specific needs or experiment with different machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. Happy predicting!
